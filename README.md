# St. Paul Crime Incidents Web App (Frontend - Vue.js)

Welcome to the StPaulCrimeVue project! This repository contains the frontend portion of the St. Paul Crime Incidents Web App, built using the Vue.js framework. The web app provides an intuitive and interactive interface for users to explore and analyze crime incident data sourced from the St. Paul Crime Incident Report dataset.

## Features

The StPaulCrimeVue project offers the following key features:

1. Crime Incident Visualization: The web app utilizes the powerful Leaflet API, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, to display crime incidents as location markers on a map. Users can easily navigate and zoom in/out of the map to explore crime incident hotspots across St. Paul.

2. Filtering and Sorting: Users can apply various filters to the crime incident data, such as incident types, neighborhood names, start and end times of the day, or within a specific date range. This feature allows users to narrow down the displayed incidents based on their preferences and interests. Additionally, the data can be sorted based on different criteria such as incident date or incident type.

3. Submission of New Incidents: The StPaulCrimeVue project enables users to contribute to the dataset by submitting new crime incidents. This functionality encourages community engagement and ensures that the crime data remains up-to-date and comprehensive.

4. Responsive and User-Friendly Design: The Vue.js framework facilitates the development of a responsive and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes. The interface is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, allowing users to effortlessly interact with the crime incident data.
